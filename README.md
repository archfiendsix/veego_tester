# Project Name

This project is built using Python and utilizes a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Setting up the environment
1. Install Python on your local machine if it is not already installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install virtualenv on your local machine by running `pip install virtualenv`.
3. Create a new virtual environment by running `virtualenv venv`. This will create a new folder called `venv` in your project directory.
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS or `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` on Windows.

## Installing dependencies
1. Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the project
1. Make sure you are in the virtual environment by running `which python`. It should return the path of the python interpreter inside the virtual environment.
2. Run the project by running `pytest main.py` or `python3 main.py`.

## Deactivating the environment
1. Once you are done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment by running `deactivate`.

## Note
Make sure to always activate the virtual environment before running the project and installing any dependencies.
